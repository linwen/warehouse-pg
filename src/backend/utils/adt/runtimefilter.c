 *
 * runtimefilter.c
 *	  Runtime filters for hash joins: the filter (a split-block Bloom filter
 *	  over join-key hash values), the probe of the clause the planner puts
 *	  in the probe scan's qual (a RuntimeFilterExpr), and the helpers that
 *	  recognize that clause.
 *
 * Once a hash join has built its hash table it knows exactly which join
 * keys the inner side holds. When the probe side's scan runs in the same
 * slice, the join hands that scan a Bloom filter over those keys through an
 * exec Param -- set by nodeHashjoin.c, read by the clause planrtfilter.c
 * adds to the scan's qual -- and the scan drops the rows that cannot have a
 * match before they are assembled, projected or handed up to the join. On an
 * AOCO table the clause can lead a Staged Scan, so the other columns are not
 * even decompressed for those rows.
 *
 * The filter is built from the same 32-bit hash values the hash table is
 * built with (ExecHashGetHashValue()), and the probe computes the value with
 * the hash function of the probe side's operand type -- the one the join
 * itself would have applied to the row. So a probe costs one hash function
 * call, which the join had to pay anyway, plus one cache line.
 *
 * The filter is a split-block Bloom filter: 256-bit blocks of eight 32-bit
 * words, one bit set in each word, so that a probe touches a single cache
 * line. It is sized from the planner's estimate of the inner rows at about
 * 16 bits per key (roughly 1% false positives) and capped by
 * whpg_runtime_filter_max_size. The rows that arrive decide what becomes of
 * it (nodeHashjoin.c): a filter the estimate left too small -- more than
 * RF_MAX_FILL of its bits set -- is built again from the hash table at the
 * size the rows call for, when the table is all in memory and that size is
 * within the limit, and dropped otherwise (the Param stays NULL) rather than
 * let a dense filter cost probes for nothing; one the estimate left too
 * large is folded down to the size its keys need (runtimefilter_fold()). A
 * false positive only costs the hash table probe the join would have made
 * anyway; a NULL key is rejected, since a strict hash operator never
 * matches it.
